        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>
          It all started in January 2001 when two brothers came together united by their love for Pizza. Mario and Luigi are the proud founders of <em>Eatalian Pizza</em>.
          The brand has become a household name offering it's clients the opportunity to watch their pizzas come to life with their build-your-own pizza model.
          The company has since thrived and grown exponentially with stores all over Nairobi, and has quickly become a family favourite establishment.
        <p/>
        <p>
          Most recently, the company has invested in developing a digital platform where clients can build their own pizzas right from the comfort of their homes, offices or even
          classrooms! Furthermore, clients have the option of having their bespoke pizzas delivered right to their doorstep with the brand new delivery option.
